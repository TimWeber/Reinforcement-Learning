# Aim
This project was created during a university lectuer as an introduction to reinforcement learning.

### The program
The idea behind this program was to create a desert island where '0' represents the sea, '1' represents the land or grass, '2' represents a small goal and '3' represents a larger goal. The objective is to try and avoid the sea and reach the larger goal through reinforcement learning. 

### What this is trying to achieve
With this program I hope to achieve a level of understanding on both python and reinforcement learning with the end state being that I am comfortable enough to be able to design an algorithm with real world capabilities - such as a small car that is able to navigate itself to a goal.
